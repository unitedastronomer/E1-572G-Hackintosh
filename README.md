### üõ†Ô∏è This OpenCore configuration is optimized for this specific hardware. 
   * [Start a discussion](https://github.com/unitedastronomer/E1-572G-Hackintosh/discussions) if you have some questions.

I have already tried to make this config to work at it's best potential, I may not be able to update anymore.

 ‚ö†Ô∏è Proceed at your own risk!
Please refer the Dortania Opencore Install Guide as your main guide. Consider this as supplemental.

### What's not working?

- AirDrop, and other Airport related features.
- Accessing DRM content (macOS 11+)
- Lid Wake, requires keyboard intervention.
- Fan reading
- Hibernation [:)](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/386#issuecomment-503042790)

* There is a weird issue where the USB 2.0 and internal ports transfers from XHC to EHC after sleep.

# Preparation

### BIOS 

*  **Update BIOS to the** [**latest version**](https://www.acer.com/us-en/support/product-support/Aspire_E1-572G). This resolves the issue of the laptop failing to fully power down when shutting down.
* Configure the BIOS with these settings: **Secure Boot** -> **Disabled**

### config.plist

In the config.plist, section <code>PlatformInfo > Generic</code> is currently left empty, generate your own SMBIOS data. 
* Use a **MacbookPro11,1** SMBIOS

This OC configuration was set up to allow booting macOS versions as early as High Sierra up to Sonoma. Some security was lifted up needed to allow root patching in restoring WiFi since Monterey, and Graphics Acceleration since Ventura.
* If you choose to install Big Sur or earlier, you can leave this config as-is or re-enable them by:
    * Delete `amfi=0x80` in boot-args
    * Set `csr-active-config` to `00000000`
    * Disable these Kernel -> Patches
      * Force FileVault on Broken Seal
      * Disable Library Validation Enforcement
      * Disable _csr_check() in _vnode_check_signature
    * Set `SecureBootModel` to `Default`, and do an NVRAM Reset if you have set this setting after OS was already installed.

# Installation 

#### Note:

* Don't stop midway of the installation process; **patience is key!**
If you can't get past a looping error code, (from e.g., `failed lookup: name = com.apple.logd`): remove the battery, and press power button for at least 30 seconds.


### macOS Monterey+
Support for Atheros WiFi had already been dropped long time ago, re-injecting the older kext was the option to restore WiFi functionality. However there were some changes in Monterey, and injecting the kexts with a bootloader alone won't work. If you stll have the AR9565:

1. Download the **LATEST** Opencore Legacy Patcher, and place it where you can easily access it under macOS.
2. After macOS installation. Run OCLP, accept permissions. Reboot when prompted by OCLP app.


### macOS Ventura+
Graphics Acceleration had been dropped in Ventura, so you'll need to restore it with the help of Opencore Legacy Patcher. If you stll have the AR9565, this will also apply the patches to restore WiFi functionality 

1. Download the **LATEST** Opencore Legacy Patcher, and place it where you can easily access it under macOS.
2. After macOS installation. Run OCLP, accept permissions. Reboot when prompted by OCLP app.

#
 * Do not use Migration Assistant within the Setup Assistant (setup screen right after macOS installation)
 * Do not use Migration Assistant if root patches are applied, revert patches first then apply it back after using Migration Assistant.

# Post-Install

### Cosmetic

* Disable Verbose Mode: Remove `-v` under NVRAM -> Add > 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 > boot-args.
* Hide boot picker: Misc -> Boot -> ShowPicker. Set it to **`Disabled`**.
  - Only do if you are **NOT** multi-booting.

### Troubleshoot
* Unable to [set the boot option back to macOS](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/multiboot/bootcamp.html#installation) after booting on windows?
* [Fixing Window features after installing macOS](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/I_Windows/Windows_fixes.md)
* [Use Windows partition under macOS via VMWare](https://github.com/mackonsti/s145-14iwl/blob/master/Fusion.md)
* [Install Windows on a partition without USB](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/I_Windows/Install_Windows_NoBootcamp.md)
  * Just wait when booting for the first time, it will take a while!
  * Set macOS as Startup Disk so that the selector on boot menu will automatically highlight macOS, instead of what comes first in the picker.
* It is recommended to edit config.plist with Propertree.
  * Opencore Configurator is known to corrupt plist.


Fun fact: VGA port is actually a DisplayPort internally, you may need to adjust the device properties - such as the connector type, bus ID, etc.
