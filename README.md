# Preparation

### BIOS 

*  **Update BIOS to the** [**latest version**](https://www.acer.com/us-en/support/product-support/Aspire_E1-572G). This resolves the issue of the laptop failing to fully power down when shutting down.
* Configure BIOS with these settings:
	* **Secure Boot** &rarr; **Disabled**
	* **F12 Boot** &rarr; **Enabled**

### config.plist

In the config.plist, section <code>PlatformInfo > Generic</code> is currently left empty, [generate your own SMBIOS data](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS). Use a **MacbookPro11,1** SMBIOS.

# Post-Install

* **Do not update AppleALC**. `-alcbeta` boot-arg allows AppleALC to load up until macOS Sequoia. It is compiled to only contain layout 28 of ALC282. 
	* 86KB (vs. originally 3.43 MB).

## macOS Monterey, Ventura and Sonoma

Patches are needed to be applied using Opencore Legacy Patcher to restore WiFi functionality since macOS 12.x, and Graphics Acceleration since macOS 13.x. 

 * Do not use Migration Assistant within the Setup Assistant (setup screen right after macOS installation)
 * Do not use Migration Assistant if root patches are applied, revert patches first then apply them back after using Migration Assistant.

## macOS Seqouia
* [OCLP](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher) support for Haswell's Integrated Graphics, and Legacy wireless are provided in the nightly build.
* Requires [disabling Gatekeeper](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/14_OCLP_Wintel/Guides/Disable_Gatekeeper.md).

## macOS Big Sur and earlier
> [!WARNING]  
> This can't be applied for Monterey and newer.

This OC configuration has disabled AMFI, and SIP partially disabled, these are necessary for root patching.  You can leave this config as-is or re-enable them by:
* Disable `AMFIPass.kext`
* Delete `amfi=0x80` in boot-arg to re-enable AMFI
* Set `csr-active-config` to `00000000` fully enable SIP
 * Disable these Kernel -> Patches:
   * Force FileVault on Broken Seal
   * Disable Library Validation Enforcement
   * Disable _csr_check() in _vnode_check_signature
* Set `SecureBootModel` to `Default`, and then do an NVRAM Reset before booting into macOS

# Troubleshoot
* Multi-boot with Windows
	* Once booted through Windows, Windows' boot manager will always take over the boot order on restart and you'll be unable to boot through OpenCore. To resolve this, [install Bootcamp utilities](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/multiboot/bootcamp.html#installation) in Windows after installing macOS (only if you are multi-booting).
* Cannot connect to Wi-Fi
	* To work around this, manually connect using the "Other" option in the Wi-Fi menu bar or manually add the network in the "Network" preference pane.
* [Fixing Window features after installing macOS](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/I_Windows/Windows_fixes.md)
* [Use Windows partition under macOS via VMWare](https://github.com/mackonsti/s145-14iwl/blob/master/Fusion.md)
