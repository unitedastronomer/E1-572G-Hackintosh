# Preparation

### BIOS 

*  **Update BIOS to the** [**latest version**](https://www.acer.com/us-en/support/product-support/Aspire_E1-572G). This resolves the issue of the laptop failing to fully power down when shutting down.
* Configure the BIOS with these settings: **Secure Boot** -> **Disabled**

### config.plist

In the config.plist, section <code>PlatformInfo > Generic</code> is currently left empty, generate your own SMBIOS data. 
* Use a **MacbookPro11,1** SMBIOS

This OpenCore configuration was set up to allow booting macOS versions as early as High Sierra up to Sonoma. Some security was lifted up needed to allow root patching.
* If you choose to install Big Sur or earlier, you can leave this config as-is or re-enable security features by:
    * Delete `amfi=0x80` in boot-args
    * Set `csr-active-config` to `00000000`
    * Disable these Kernel -> Patches
      * Force FileVault on Broken Seal
      * Disable Library Validation Enforcement
      * Disable _csr_check() in _vnode_check_signature
    * Set `SecureBootModel` to `Default`, and do an NVRAM reset if you have set this setting after OS was already installed.

## macOS Monterey, Ventura and Sonoma
Root patching via Opencore Legacy Patcher is needed to restore Graphics Acceleration since Ventura, and WiFi functionality since Monterey.

 * Do not use Migration Assistant within the Setup Assistant (setup screen right after macOS installation)
 * Do not use Migration Assistant if root patches are applied, revert patches first then apply it back after using Migration Assistant.

# Post-Install


### Troubleshoot
* Don't stop midway of the installation process; **patience is key!**
	* If you can't get past a looping error code, (from e.g., `failed lookup: name = com.apple.logd`): remove the battery, and press power button for at least 30 seconds.
* Unable to [set the boot option back to macOS](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/multiboot/bootcamp.html#installation) after booting on windows?
* [Fixing Window features after installing macOS](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/I_Windows/Windows_fixes.md)
* [Use Windows partition under macOS via VMWare](https://github.com/mackonsti/s145-14iwl/blob/master/Fusion.md)


#### Note:
* Fun fact: VGA port is actually a DisplayPort internally according to the schematics, you may need to adjust the device properties - such as the connector type, bus ID, etc.
