### Note:
* The install is taking too long? Just be patient! Do not manually power off or reboot your machine as this will break the installation and require reinstalling. 
* Do not use Migration Assistant within Setup Assistant (setup screen right after macOS installation) on macOS 13+. It would be too laggy to navigate.
* Do not use Migration Assistant if root patches are applied, revert patches first then apply them back after using Migration Assistant.
* **Do not update AppleALC**. It is compiled to only contain layout 28 of ALC282. 
* Can't add or adjust Memoji in settings?
	* Scroll through the emojis, this will zoom out the icons allowing you to edit memojis.
* Sleep may randomly break if the machine is still doing a heavy task while it is transitioning into sleep mode on it's own. 
	* Temporary disable sleep via `pmset` command if you are doing something important.
* VGA port is actually a DisplayPort internally according to the schematics, you may need to adjust the device properties.

### What's not working?

- Playing DRM content (on Safari 14+ and macOS 11+)
	- To work around this, use a Chromium-based browser or Firefox.
- Bluetooth (Atheros; on macOS 12+)
	- To work around this, use a Bluetooth dongle with Broadcom/CSR chip (e.g, ASUS BT400, and TP-Link UB400).

	- Disable it.

 - & a [lot more](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/1008) on macOS macOS 13+

### Other Weird Issues:

* If you at least once booted from Windows then macOS, certain ports transfer from XHC to EHC after sleep.  
* WiFi icon will only show one bar, this is a known issue with this WiFi card.
