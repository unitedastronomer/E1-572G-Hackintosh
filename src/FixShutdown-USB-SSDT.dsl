/*
    github.com/unitedastronomer:
    If this was present, XHC shutsdown/sleep properly (I think) when I set the laptop to sleep,
    but USB 2.0 and internal device transfers from XHC to EHC ports. 
    
    I somehow can't replicate the switching anymore when I switched to SSDT USB Mapping from USBMap. Weird.
